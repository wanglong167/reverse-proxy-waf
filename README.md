# Reverse proxy web application firewall prototype

`waf.js` is a reverse proxy web application firewall (WAF).
This WAF is built by using Nodejs. Technically the WAF connects to the destination server by providing IP and Port of destination.


Its main goals are to demonstrate well known application security methods and algorithms implemented on a server-side of web application.

`waf.js` it's just a prototype and must not be used in production.
